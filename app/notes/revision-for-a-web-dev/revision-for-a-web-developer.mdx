# **Revision for a web developer**

Well, Today, I find myself unexpectedly penning down these notes, a response that was prompted by a colleague's curiosity regarding the essential knowledge for their current role. As my junior, they sought insights into the realms of JavaScript, React, and the nuances of TypeScript.

Maybe I talked with him so quickly that he told me to write my notes because he thinks that I am very good at explaining things that I know.

During my college and school time before exams, my friends used to ask me for revision for certain questions. A friend named Bhavesh fondly recalls, even now, how my succinct explanations in our native language of Gujarati enabled him to translate my three-minute summaries into three pages of eloquent answers on English-language exams.

Maybe I'm not an expert or as knowledgeable as thought leaders or some influencers on tech Twitter. Maybe whatever I write below is not exactly a silver bullet or a golden rule or whatever you call it.

So, Welcome to my collection of notesâ€”a fusion of knowledge and experience.

## **JavaScript: Beyond Syntax**

JavaScript is more than a mere syntax, a concept that every web developer should grasp:

1. **Currying**: Understanding the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take one argument.
2. **Closures**: The concept of functions retaining access to variables even after they have exited their scope.
3. **Execution Context**: The mechanism that manages the execution of JavaScript code.
4. **Event Loop**: The asynchronous nature of JavaScript through its event-driven execution model.
5. **Async Await**: Writing asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner.
6. **Hoisting**: Behavior of variable and function declarations being moved to the top of their respective scopes.
7. **Promise**: A crucial tool for handling asynchronous operations.
8. **Scope**: Global, Local, and Block scopes, each with its implications.
9. **Array Methods**: Methods that empower developers to manipulate arrays effectively.
10. **Callback**: Understanding the concept of passing functions as arguments to other functions to execute to pass further.
11. **Inheritance**: Both classical and prototypal.
12. **Prototype**: The prototype chain and its role in object-oriented programming.
13. **Higher Order Functions**:  Functions that can manipulate and work with other functions.
14. **Value & Reference**: Differentiating between value types and reference types in JavaScript's variable assignments.

## **React: Unveiling the Library's Core**

React, a JavaScript UI library forms the foundation for modern web development:

1. **Hooks**: The versatile Hooks that have revolutionized state management and component logic.
2. **React.createElement**: A critical insight into this foundational function, deserving attention.
3. **When Not to Use State**: Scenarios where utilizing React's state might not be the optimal approach.
4. **The Importance of Keys**: Unraveling the significance of keys in React's virtual DOM rendering.
5. **Thinking in React**: A philosophical journey into comprehending the essence of components and their composition.
6. **Virtual DOM**: The inner workings of the Virtual DOM, a cornerstone of React's performance optimization.
7. **Component Lifecycles**: Understanding the sequence of events in a component's lifecycle and their applications.

In the forthcoming installments of these notes, I shall give my best to explain each concept with the same enthusiasm that was acclaimed earlier. Through this journal, I aim to bridge the gap between complex concepts and accessible understanding.

Warm regards,

Rakesh.
