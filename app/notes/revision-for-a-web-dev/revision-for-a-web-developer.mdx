# Revision for a web developer

Well, I had no plans to start his notes, but one of my colleagues generally asked what he must know about the current position. He is my junior. I casually talk about JavaScript and other topics like React, and some topics around typescript. 

Maybe I talked with him so quickly that he told me to write my notes or blog something because he thinks that I am very good at explaining things that I know.

During my college and school time before exams, my friends used to ask me for revision for certain questions. One friend named, Bhavesh still says, whenever we meet, ‚ÄúYour explanations saved me in exams, you just summarize so nicely in Gujarati [our native language, because exams we were writing in English üòõ] that I could write three pages for whatever you explained in nearly 3 minutes‚Äù.

Maybe I'm not an expert or as knowledgeable as thought leaders or some influencers on tech Twitter. Maybe whatever I write below is not exactly a silver bullet or a golden rule or whatever you call it.

So welcome to my notes.

### JavaScript

More than just syntax. 

- Currying
- Closures
- Execution Context
- Event Loop
- Async await
- Hoisting
- Promise
- Scope [Global, Local, Block]
- Array methods
- Callback
- == vs ===

### Not at all getting paid but I ‚ù§Ô∏è¬†this

## React

Hooks, obviously but before that

1. React.createElement [very important, do not skip]
